        This method is intended to copy values from one list (original list) to another (pointer_2)
starting at specified positions and up to a given number of nodes (size). The function takes in few
arguments: self is original list or pointer, ptr1_start_idx is the starting position in the original list
from  which  copying  begins,  pointer_2  is  the  target  list  where  the  values  will  be  copied,
ptr2_start_idx is the starting position in the target list where copied values will be placed. Positions
follow the syntax of Python sequences [0, size-1]. No changes are made to the lists when any of
the starting points are not within the corresponding list size. size parameter is the number of values
to be copied from source (self) to destination (pointer_2). If size is larger than original listâ€™s length,
then size becomes the size of the original list.
NOTE :-  Memory allocation is done only when malloc(), calloc() or realloc() methods are called
on the pointer (list). So if there is no memory then, copying of values is not done. This is depicted
in the first examples in the doctests given below.
